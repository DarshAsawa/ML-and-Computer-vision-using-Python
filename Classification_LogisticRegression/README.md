# LOGISTIC REGRESSION

It is a technique or algorithm for Classification in Machine Learning.

In this algorithm, output is predicted in the form of a binary variable i.e. only two outcomes after analysing a dataset
which has one or more independent variable i.e. predictor and a dependent variable i.e. predictant for model training and prediction.
Dependent variable or predictant has to be in binary form. 

Logisitc Regression is a function and a part of Sklearn module (scitkit-learn library).

### Libraries Used:
1. pandas 
2. scikit-learn
3. seaborn
