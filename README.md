# **My Python Programs**
With a new start to new language, I'm side by side adding my python programs to Github repository so that other contributers can take help and ideas from my modules.

### List of **Codes** (with their description):
1. 1st_Program.py : First ever program to get a input from user, and then display a welcome message by using the entered name.
2. Calculator.py : A very basic calculator program to add, subtract, multiply, divide and modulo of two numbers via simple use of arithmetic operators.
3. Looping.py : Understanding the loops in python like 'for' loop and 'while' loop. 
4. Type_Variable.py : There are variables of different data types. To check the type of variable at any point of time, type() function is used in python.
