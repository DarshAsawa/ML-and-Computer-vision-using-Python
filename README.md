# **My Python Programs**
With a new start to new language, I'm side by side adding my python programs to Github repository so that other contributers can take help and ideas from my modules.

### List of **Codes** (with their description):
1. 1st_Program.py : First ever program to get a input from user, and then display a welcome message by using the entered name.
2. Calculator.py : A very basic calculator program to add, subtract, multiply, divide and modulo of two numbers.
